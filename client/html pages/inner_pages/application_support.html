        <h3 class="one-text-color">Application Support</h3>
        <p>We provide technical and functional resources which can support the day-to-day operations of the products which are available through OneAston, and additionally for third party platforms such as the Triple'A system from Temenos. Our teams can be deployed full time on-site or remotely with on-site intervention, following a strict Service Level Agreement, and would perform such tasks such as ensuring the availability of the application, execution of external interfaces, repair system outages, answer end-user support questions and the like. The advantage of the OneAston Application Support service is that our clients do not need to build a large and specialised application team and can leverage off a centralised pool of qualified OneAston resources.</p>
