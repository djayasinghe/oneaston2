                <p>We provide specialised resources which can support the day-to-day issues found when running your wealth platform, including the configurations, reports and Interfaces deployed. Our teams can be deployed full time on-site or remotely with on-site intervention, following a strict Service Level Agreement, and would perform such tasks such as ensuring the availability of the application, execution of external interfaces, repair system outages, answer end-user support questions and the like. At Oneston, we will support any of our deliverables and in addition the third party platforms, such as the Temenos Triple'A and T24 systems, in which we specialise. The advantage of the OneAston Application Management Support service is that our clients do not need to build a large and specialised application team and can leverage off a centralised pool of qualified OneAston resources.

Our testing team is able to conduct and manage Integration testing, functional user testing and performance testing.
