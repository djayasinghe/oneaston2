                    <h3>Large local Hong Kong Bank automating its Private Banking Platform</h3>
                    <p>
                        As one of the largest local banks in Hong Kong, our client had recently established a private banking department and was experiencing very solid growth. There was a need to implement a modern private banking solution which could automate much of the front and middle office to ensure the system had the capacity to support the growth. Our client selected the Temenos Triple’A solution and the combination of this together with the OneAston OneStart configuration offered a platform on which these requirements could be met.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/ip-img8.jpg" width="100%"/>
                    <p>
                        The bank had 9 in-house systems which were used by the retail and corporate business activities and wanted use these to process and settle the investment products which would be offered by the Private Bank. The objective of the bank was to leverage these existing core systems to share operations and to ease the overall consolidation required for regulatory and management reporting. There was also a need to offer International Equities, however as this was currently not supported by the internal systems, these were processed by Triple’A, generating the necessary cash management and associated GL postings.

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Triple’A and OneStart was implemented to provide order capture and STP processing through to the relevant in-house system. All investment data was stored in Triple’A which was then used to provide a consolidated client view, in addition to consolidated client statements and performance measurement, which were integrated into the bank’s client portal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Client onboarding was implemented in Triple’A including the necessary HKMA client and risk classifications. This allowed the extensive pre-trade checking of OneStart to be implemented, including product suitability, cash/product availability

                    </p>
                    <img src="images/box-img1.jpg" class="img-small" />
                    <p>
                        Credit Management and Monitoring was a key requirement and has been implemented to allow the Bank to effectively managed their leveraged portfolios, in addition to performing pre-trade collateral checking to control customers are not placing orders that exceed their approved limits.
A workflow for voluntary corporate actions was required and this hence the OneEvent module was deployed and integrated with Triple’A to effectively manage the process from notification, though to client election and position settlement.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project was delivered over three phases with the first phase, encompassing back to front interfaces to the core systems and client statements, being put into production only 6 months after the commencement of the project. Progressive phases encompassed the STP data flows, credit processing and KYC enhancements.

                    <h3>Chinese bank establishing their Private Bank in Hong Kong
</h3>
                    <p>

                        With the growth of wealth within China, many Chinese banks are looking to establish a private banking operation in Hong Kong. Our client was already operating a corporate banking operation in Hong Kong, but want to extend this to provide Private Banking Services. An existing core banking platform was in place to support the corporate bank which was used as the basis of accounting and settlement for the private bank.

                    </p>
                    <img src="images/ip-img9.jpg" width="100%"/>
                    <p>
                        By implementing the Temenos Triple’A together with the OneAston OneStart configuration, the client was able to adopt the standard product and transaction flows necessary for the private bank, but integrate these with a link to the existing core banking system for settlement. Triple’A and OneStart produced the client statement and advices in English and Chinese
The project was implemented within two phases. The first phase covered the implementation of cash and securities products, including the client statement, and was put live within six months. The second phase incorporated the expansion of investment products to cover structured products. It also included the launch of Lombard Lending, allowing the bank to provide leverage and facilities to its growing client base.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a testament to the flexibility of the Triple’A together with OneStart, the bank replaced it’s core banking solution within a year after launching the private bank which had minimal impact on the front and middle office configuration.

                    <h3>Taiwanese Bank implementing Triple’A Standalone
</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our client was a Taiwanese bank launching private banking in Hong Kong, but unlike other customers, as it was a start-up operation they had not yet implemented a core banking solution. As such Temenos Triple’A together OneAston OneStart was required to provide the front, middle and back office functions.

                    </p>
                    <img src="images/ip-img10.jpg" class="img-small" />
                    <p>
                        The bank adopted the OneStart configuration, performing minimal customization required for the consolidation of data for head office reporting. As such the solution provides deal capture, position keeping, valuation, cash flow management and operations processing.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                       The implementation of the GL module meant that GL postings and balances are generated directly by Triple’A using the OneLedger module and sent to the group GL for consolidation. In addition, Triple’A produces the output necessary for the generation of the HKMA and MIS reporting. The client statement and transaction advices, in addition to operations reporting is produced by Triple’A
The scope of the project included the OneStart standard investment products including cash, loans, deposits, securities, Funds, FX and structured products. An interface to Summit, which is used by the treasury department, will be integrated to allow an online link between the Private Bank and Treasury.
Phase 1 of the project was completed in 6 months and included the integration of Lombard lending such that the bank can offered leveraging and facilities. Phase two of the project expanded the coverage to include the investment products offered and to provide integration with the Summit treasury system.
