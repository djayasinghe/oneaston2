            <p>OneAston has launched its new digital channel delivery application OneNotify. OneNotify allows events detected in external systems to trigger notification messages to be sent by SMS, WeChat or Email. The notification messages are configurable and can be sent in a number of different languages and multiple recipients depending on the preferences of the client.  
 </p>
            <p>OneNotify is preconfigured with some standard notifications covering events such as Account Opening, Transaction Execution, Credit Monitoring, Ingoing/Outgoing Funds Transfer and Client Surveys. As an open architecture system, it is able to interface with multiple external systems and is delivered with a standard interface to the Temenos Triple’A Plus solution.
            </p>
            <p>
              The product is currently being deployed at a client in Hong Kong together with Triple’A plus and has generated a great deal of interest from other Triple’A plus clients.
