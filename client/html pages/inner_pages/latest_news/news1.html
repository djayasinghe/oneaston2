        <p>In line with it's Asian growth strategy, OneAston has opened an Australian operation, based in Melbourne. With the continued growth of the Australian financial markets, and the increasing need to expand existing platforms to accommodate market changes, reinforcing core software platforms continues to become a top priority for Australian financial institutions. Built on the strengths of the OneAston model, the new operation will mean that the OneAston products and services can now be provided and supported within the Australasian market. "We are confident that our move into the Australian market will further enhance our company value proposition to all clients and generate good growth to our business." says Dave White, co-founder and Director of OneAston.</p>
